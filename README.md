# INTELLIGENT GESTURE-DRIVEN VIRTUAL BLACKBOARD
  This Python project utilizes the MediaPipe library for hand tracking to enable gesture-based interactions with a virtual blackboard. Users can draw, erase, control 
  volume, and move the cursor using hand gestures captured through a webcam.

# Features:
* Hand Gesture Recognition: Detects hand gestures in real-time using MediaPipe Hands.
* Virtual Blackboard: Allows users to draw and erase on a virtual blackboard using their fingers.
* Character Recognition: Utilizes Tesseract OCR to recognize handwritten characters.
* Volume Control: Adjusts system volume based on hand gestures.
* Cursor Control: Controls cursor movement and clicking using hand gestures.
